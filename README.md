# 🛒 AwesomeShop Microservices

AwesomeShop is a modular e-commerce backend built using microservices architecture with .NET. It demonstrates how to structure, test, and deploy scalable services using modern development practices.([Awesome Open Source][1])

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

This project follows a domain-driven, event-based microservices design.

### Services

* **Orders Service**: Handles order creation, processing, and management.
* **(Planned)**: Additional services like Catalog, Payments, and Users.

### Key Concepts

* **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**: Follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
* **Unit Test Naming Convention**: Uses the `Given_When_Then` format for clarity.

  * Example: `InputDataIsOk_Executed_ReturnProjectId`([orbra.institute][2])

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* .NET 6 SDK or later
* Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Running the Project

1. Clone the repository:([GitHub][3])

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fabianoGDB/awesomeshop-microservices.git
   cd awesomeshop-microservices
   ```


2\. Navigate to the Orders service:

```bash
cd Order/AwesomeShop.Services.Orders
```


3\. Restore dependencies and run the service:
